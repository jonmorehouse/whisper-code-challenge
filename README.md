# Whisper Code Challenge

I spent about a half day doing Haskell in the past, and decided to dig into this problem with Haskell.

I came up with a pretty simple haskell solution, and then dug in to try and create a pretty complex one liner. I utilized irc to help me with a few syntax issues on the second implementation.

To grasp the problem, I wrote out some python code, just to explore the problem in a language I'm super comfortable in.
